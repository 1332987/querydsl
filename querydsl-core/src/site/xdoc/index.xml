     <p>Query DSL is a grammar for constructing SQL SELECT like queries on top of domain models. Query DSL queries are statically typed and therefore autocomplete features of Java IDEs can be used. In addition to this many errors can be catched while editing.</p>

     <p>Difficult to read in IDE</p>
     <p>
     With standard JDT java editors the Query DSL syntax is somewhat difficult to read. The syntax coloring could be improved in the following way
       <ul>
         <li>methods of the Query and ExtQuery signature are emphasized in similar way like reserved words in Java</li>
         <li>methods calls inside those methods that use symbols of the Grammar (as, and, or etc) should also be emphasized as reserved words</li>
         <li>static variables and methods should not be shown in italic style in methods of the Query / ExtQuery interface</li>
       </ul>
