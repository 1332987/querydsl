# Querydsl #

Querydsl is a framework which enables the construction of type-safe SQL-like queries for multiple backends including JPA, JDO and SQL in Java.

Instead of writing queries as inline strings or externalizing them into XML files they are constructed via a fluent API.

Issue tracking is hosted on Launchpad https://bugs.launchpad.net/querydsl.
